Food Ordering Rest API in Spring Boot, Mongo
Introduction

Framework and Database
The Restapi is developed using the Spring Boot framework, which is a popular and widely used framework for building web applications in Java.
MongoDB is used as the database for this application, which is a NoSQL database that provides high scalability and flexibility.

Async Support
To handle a large number of requests efficiently and improve the performance of the application, the Restapi is developed with async support. 
This means that requests can be processed asynchronously, which allows multiple requests to be handled simultaneously, improving the overall response time.

Docker Containerization
The Restapi can be easily containerized using Docker, a containerization platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and 
run applications in a containerized environment.This makes it easier to deploy the Restapi on different environments, making it more 
scalable and easier to manage.

Spring Profile
The Restapi also supports different environment configurations using Spring profile. This means that the application can be configured 
to work in different environments such as development, testing, and production. This enables developers to test the application in 
different environments before deploying it to production.

AWS SES Integration
The Restapi is integrated with AWS SES (Simple Email Service), a cloud-based email sending service provided by Amazon Web Services. 
This feature allows the application to send emails to customers, such as order confirmations or password reset emails.

Google Sheets Integration
The Restapi can also fetch data from Google Sheets, which is a cloud-based spreadsheet application provided by Google. This feature is useful for restaurants 
as it allows them to easily manage and catalogue their menu items, prices, and other related information.


Overall, the Restapi developed in Spring Boot with MongoDB and other features is an efficient and easy-to-use API that provides several useful features for restaurants.


Conclusion
The Restapi developed using Spring Boot with MongoDB and async support along with Docker and support for environment using Spring profile
is an efficient and easy-to-use API. The integration with AWS SES and Google Sheets provides additional functionality that makes it more useful
for restaurant purposes.
